/*5. Write a C program to solve the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0.

A quadratic equation has two roots which are given by the following two formulas:
root1= -b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)/2*a
root2= -b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)/2*a

The program request the user for input a,b,c and the output will be root1 and root2.*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main()
{
    float a,b,c,root1,root2; 	//variables for the formula and the input of the coefficients.
